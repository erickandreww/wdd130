    <p>Hello Guys! 
        <br> My name is Erick, I'm 24 years old and I'm from Brasil, SÃ£o Paulo. </p>
    <p> I'm studying programming at BYU-Idaho online University. 
        <br>I love to play games, my favorite one is Dark Souls. And I'm not very creative with presentations haha. 
        I'm currently working as an administrative assistant at a small enterprise. 
        <br>I love studying at BYU-Idaho University, I really like the teaching method and assignment formulation, it's helping me a lot to learn and keep things in mind.
        <br>I'm very excited for this semester and wish all of us a great semester. 
    </p>
